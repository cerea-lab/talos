Version 0.3 (2004-10-02)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added 'ConfigStreams' to manage several configuration files as a single
  configuration file.
- Added the support of markup substitutions for configuration files.
- Talos now supports exceptions in 'ExtStream' and 'ConfigStream*', e.g. if
  an element is not found (method 'Find').
- Added methods:
   + ConfigStream::SetMarkupTags
   + ConfigStream::GetMarkupTags
   + ExtStream::FindFromBeginning
   + ExtStream::IsEmpty
   + ExtStream::SkipFullLines
   + ExtStream::SkipLines
   + ExtStream::SkipElements
   + ExtStream::SkipNumbers
- ExtStream now properly deals with booleans.
- Added methods:
   + Date::GetWeekDay
   + Date::GetNumberOfDays
   + Date::GetNumberOfHours
   + Date::GetNumberOfMinutes
   + Date::GetNumberOfSeconds
   + Date::Date()
- Added functions:
   + string fill(const string&, ...)
   + print(const vector<T>&)
   + split_markup
   + lower_case
   + upper_case
- Overloaded 'convert' to convert strings to booleans.

** Bug fixes:

- 'ExtStream::Rewind' failed if a previous operation on the stream
  failed, e.g. if EOF was read.
- In 'Date::Adjust': negative seconds and minutes were not well handled.
